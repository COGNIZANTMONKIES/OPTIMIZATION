Why Practice Optimization?

* lowers electric bills
* lowers hardware bill
* lowers latency
* reduces staff
* near-instant loadtime
* near-instant runtime
* great user experience
* overall thinking improves
* higher salary

Origins of Optimization

  Where there are limitations, optimization follows behind.
  Optimizations timelime stretches as far as the first human artifact.
  Fabricating tools from sticks, rocks, vegetation, and all the Earths 
  provided surroundings. Building these tools drained our energy, 
  cut our hands, dehydrated us, sometimes broke bones. To obtain the resources,
  bipedals we are, travelled barefoot far and wide, scavenging for resources.
  Farming and colonies popped into existence. A new and constant problem 
  arose from those activities. REPLICATION. Duplicating things becomes time 
  consuming. Since we converted from nomads to domesticants, our survival 
  dependency transitioned from hunting to replication of food, tools, shelter, etc.
  Resources are limited. Shelter spares the body from the elements ruthless erosion.
  Shelter for everyone required us to think ahead and be clever with what we have.
  Molding materials like bricks with holes in the center to conserve supply and lighten
  the load kills two birds one stone. Dedicating portions of trees to cut for certain areas
  of buildings saved us from extra chopping, cutting, and relocation.
  Jumping to the industrial age. One of the most important optimizations mankind
  invented were machines. Machines applied to farming accelerated crop productions.
  An abundance of food and minimal set of required harvesting hands freed us from 
  living off the land as a way of life. With free pairs of available, we moved
  onto new inventions inspired by machines. An electrical powered computer
  was conceived. Calculations crunched at mouth dropping speeds. A new set of
  free hands/minds available again. Computers then versus now were terribly slow.
  About a million times slower. Our ambitions demanded faster hardware and faster software.
  It's 2020, were in the era of Artificial Intelligence. Computer are millions of times faster
  than it's conception. Even with all this speed, AI calculations take weeks, months, and sometimes years.
  Hardware optimizations are reaching there limitations. Software optimizations were ignored because
  of the high cost of an engineer and the cheapness of purchasing faster hardware. 
  The impact of fast hardware is nothing compared to optimized software. This book will teach
  you the practice of thinking differently because optimization demands new perception
  to solve problems.
  
Financial Savings of Software Optimization  
 
Intentional Focus

Who this book is for

Wisdom
* inquisition has no bounds
* clarity see things clearly
* u can't optimize something u don't understand
* angles / broad perception
* constraints unconstrain innovation
* numbers are just numbers, until you assign value to it
