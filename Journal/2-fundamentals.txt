* 0. System ... is it binary? Is it pentary?
  
  Does the algorithm require a or many dedicated computers?
  What system or systems are you executing your project on?
  Are you writing platform specific code?
  Is your project married to a programming language?
  Is your project using multiple programming languages?
  Are you using a lightweight OS?
  What systems might the platform specific code be run on?
  
  Is this a private or shared computer?
  Single computer? Cluster computer? Node / Server Computer?
  
  CPU speed?
  How many cores?
  
  Encodings?
  
  Assembly, Interpretter, or Compiler?

* 1. Memory 

  How many registers?
  How many caches and what are the sizes of each?
  How much RAM?
  How much local storage HDD and/or SSD?
  How much cloud storage HDD and/or SSD?
  
  What are the memory transaction speeds of each component? Sometimes milking the SSD instead of pre loading into RAM might be resource conserving.
  
* 2. Logic

  What input/output ranges?
  What input/output datatypes?
  what input/output sets known?
   
  Is the input data random?
  Is the input data presorted?
  
  How many steps to complete? How many equivalent ways can you think of?
  
  Should some functions be merged together to make the overall process faster?

* 3. Computer Operators
  
  Is it possible to replace operators with bitwise operators?
  Are there alternative equivalent replacements with other operators?

* 5. Mental Language Approach
* 6. Independent versus Whole
* 7. Numerical Medium
* 8. Leveraging a function to many
* 9. BootStrap/LoadTime & Live/RunTime
